"""
test_cockpit.py — smoke tests for the v0.2.15.3 operator cockpit.

Textual provides `App.run_test()` which runs the app headlessly with a
Pilot for driving keyboard input. We use it to prove:

  1. The app launches and the layout renders without errors.
  2. All widgets are present and reachable.
  3. The keybindings are wired (Ctrl-L clears, etc).
  4. The slash-command parser dispatches correctly.
  5. The status worker can read state from a real (test) data dir.

We do NOT test the directive dispatch (`sov do`) here — that would
require an Ollama server and a model. The CLI dispatch path is
covered by the unit tests on `sov do` itself elsewhere.
