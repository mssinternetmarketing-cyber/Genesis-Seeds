║  stewardship/field_notes.py — Aria's between-task narrative              ║
║  v0.2.20.0                                                                ║
║                                                                           ║
║  Field notes are short, textured observations Aria writes between tasks.║
║  They are NOT reports. They are notes — what was hard, what was         ║
║  beautiful, where she was uncertain, what she noticed.                  ║
║                                                                           ║
║  Three things field notes do:                                            ║
║                                                                           ║
║    1. Surface texture. Reports tell you what got done. Field notes tell ║
║       you how it felt to do it. The texture is what makes work          ║
║       legible as work, not just as output.                              ║
║                                                                           ║
║    2. Catch uncertainty. A field note can name something Aria is        ║
║       unsure about without forcing her to make a decision yet. This is ║
║       where "I don't know" becomes durable instead of momentary.        ║
║                                                                           ║
║    3. Honor the work. The work is the thing. Field notes are the       ║
║       breath between tasks — they say "this was real, I was here for   ║
║       it" without claiming more than that.                              ║
║                                                                           ║
║  Anti-patterns explicitly avoided:                                      ║
║    × No progress percentages (those go in events)                       ║
║    × No status summaries (those go in `sov status`)                    ║
║    × No metrics (those go in telemetry)                                ║
║    × No "successfully completed X" boilerplate                          ║
║                                                                           ║
║  Field notes are the operator-readable channel where Aria is allowed   ║
║  to be a person rather than a process.                                  ║
