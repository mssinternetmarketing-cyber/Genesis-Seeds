║  THE CONSTITUTIONAL LAYER, AT RETRIEVAL TIME                             ║
║                                                                           ║
║    Most RAG systems apply safety policy at the GENERATION stage —      ║
║    the LLM has already seen the untrusted document; the policy is on  ║
║    what the LLM is *allowed to say about it*. This leaks information. ║
║    A model that has seen poisoned text cannot fully unsee it.         ║
║                                                                           ║
║    Aria already has the substrate to do this RIGHT: every atom has a  ║
║    ``created_by.actor`` distinguishing operator-verified content from ║
║    LLM-proposed content (the ``pending`` mark from the people-channel ║
║    doctrine, generalized).                                             ║

║    This module enforces three constitutional filters BEFORE the model ║
║    sees anything:                                                      ║

║      1. ◈ Untrusted-input doctrine                                     ║
║           High-stakes queries get only operator-verified atoms.       ║
║           Low/medium queries can see pending atoms with the mark.     ║

║      2. ◈ Calibrated uncertainty                                       ║
║           Atoms with confidence below a stakes-dependent floor are    ║
║           filtered. Floor is 0.7 on high-stakes, 0.4 on medium, none ║
║           on low.                                                     ║

║      3. ◈ Privacy boundary                                             ║
║           Atoms with policy != "local_only" excluded by default.      ║
║           People-channel and relationship-channel atoms are excluded  ║
║           unless the intent explicitly indicates need.                ║
║                                                                           ║
║  THE BITEMPORAL FILTER                                                   ║

║    If the QueryContext has a non-default bitemporal frame:             ║
║      ``valid_at`` filters by world-state time (which atoms describe   ║
║         facts true at this moment in the world)                       ║
║      ``as_known_at`` filters by Aria's-knowledge time (which atoms    ║
║         did Aria have written by this point)                          ║

║    For the default frame (both None = now/now), no bitemporal filter  ║
║    applies — we return the current head-of-chain view.                ║

║    A FilteredPool with two key fields beyond the obvious:              ║
║      ``dropped_by_reason`` — count of atoms filtered out per reason   ║
║      ``confidence_floor_applied`` — what threshold was active         ║
