"""
sovereign_agent.mem_channels — concrete memory channels.

Importing this package registers all bundled channels with the channel
registry. Aria's startup imports this package once.

To add a new channel:
  1. Create a new module here (e.g., dreams.py)
  2. Define a class `MyChannel(MemoryChannel)` with `spec = ChannelSpec(...)`
  3. Decorate or call `register_channel(MyChannel)`
  4. Add it to the import list below

The channel is then visible to ``sov channels list`` and to
``universal_recall``.
