"""Ollama client wrapper with think_mode-aware dispatch.

Architecture §6 (agent loop) + §V fragile assumption 2a/2b: thinking-mode
behavior on tool-calling is empirically validated separately from no-think.
Default policy is `plan_only`: thinking on for the planner call, off for
tool-dispatch calls.

CAPABILITY DETECTION: Not all tool-calling models support Ollama's `think`
field. Llama 3 Groq Tool Use, for instance, is a tool-calling specialist
without a thinking mode — sending `think=true` returns HTTP 400. We detect
this once per model via ``/api/show`` and silently fall back to no-think
for those models, regardless of the operator's policy. This is the right
behavior: capability mismatches aren't transient errors; they're config
truths the agent should adapt to.

# ─── Reachability probe (v0.2.26.0) ─────────────────────────────────────────

# The interpreter's offline fallback used to say only "interpreter offline"
# with no clue why. Operators were left guessing: is the daemon down? is the
# model not pulled? is the host wrong? `probe_ollama()` gives the offline
# message and `sov doctor` something specific to report.
#
# Authority: Tier 0 — pure read. Two HTTP calls at most (/api/tags + a
# membership test, no /api/show). Never starts services, never pulls models,
# never writes anything. Surfacing the diagnosis is the operator's job; the
# action is theirs.

    model_present:
