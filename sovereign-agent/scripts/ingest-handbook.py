ingest-handbook.py — seed the agent's LessonsChannel with curated
patterns from the operator handbook.

Idempotent: each lesson has a stable idempotency_id ('hb-N-slug'), so
running this twice writes exactly the same set the first time wrote.

Run as:
    python3 scripts/ingest-handbook.py

What it does:
    1. Opens atoms.db via the agent's standard helper.
    2. For each curated lesson, calls LessonsChannel.write_lesson with
       a fixed idempotency_id. The channel's _find_by_idempotency
       returns the existing atom if one was already written — so
       re-runs are no-ops on a populated DB.
    3. Reports: ingested / already-present / total.

Why lessons (and not palace triples or another channel):
    LessonsChannel.spec.voice says: "Earned. Each one bought with at
    least one mistake." The handbook patterns ARE earned — the safe
    bulk-edit pattern, the pre-dream snapshot, the label-generously
    rule were all built around real failures in this conversation. So
    'lessons' is the right home.

What this script does NOT do:
    - It doesn't ingest the entire handbook prose. That would be
      noise. We curate.
    - It doesn't dedupe by content similarity. It dedupes by ID. If
      you want to change a lesson's content, change its rule text AND
      its idempotency_id.
    - It doesn't write to palace, channels other than lessons, or any
      Tier 3 store. Lessons is Tier 2.
